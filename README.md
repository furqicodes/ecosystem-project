# hello-world

## This is a unity project about creating an ecosystem with user-based parameters in a certain area.

*Plants generation is random and based on current density of the population. They start with base storage of energy, which is a random function. With use of light they produce their energy through photosynthesis and increase their stored energy. The animal who eats the plant get that energy.*

*Animals need food, which is plants for herbivores, for every season. They consume energy based on their size just like in real world. The size of the animals based on their energy and if they drop below critic level they die.
When the animals are hungry they look for food, otherwise they wander the area.*


Future improvements:
- Carnivores will be added.
- Hunting algorithm will be added.

**Please note that all entities are basically cubes for now. But I really appreciate any 3D model contribution**
